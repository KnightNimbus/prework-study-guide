          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS and External CSS.</li>
          <li>In CSS rules, a Selector defines the element/ attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule using a comma (,). This allows the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Assigning colours in CSS can be done in many ways, including using semantic references and hexadecimal code.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
