# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created in order to help bootcamp students keep track of all of the topics they cover during the prework project. The study guide allows students to see all of the notes in one place making it easier for them to refer back to the topics they have learnt. The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.
